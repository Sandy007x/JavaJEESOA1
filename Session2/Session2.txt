Data Handling:-
Arrays -> 1 Dimentional 
       -> multi dimentional

Method:-
	-> statements executed again and again
	
Procedural Language:-

SSAD:- 

Disadvantages:-
More focus is on process/data 
Not defiened --> Real world problems to Software domain
  	     --> English word document --> Software --> difficult
ATM machine -->
	    --> welcome()
	    --> withdraw()
1 year complete 
change request   --> deposit()
		 --> accept debit and credit cards
Can not reuse same application/code


OOP:-
Class and Object
4 major 
1] Abstraction 	 --> Focus only on key aspect and ignore rest 
eg:- Person 
 --> General survey     --> 1] Name, Address, Age
 --> Educational survey --> 2] Name, qualification, grade
 --> Medical Survey     --> 3] Name, Height, Age, Blood Group

key:--> class, method, variable
Java :--> class and method

2] Encapsulation --> Binding/wrapping of data and hiding of a data (Access specifiers)
eg:- class and methods
e.g:- capsule --> contain 2 or more --> binding

3] Inheritance  --> 
4] Polymorphism --> 1 thing many forms --> greekword

		--> rewrite methods better
class Arithmetic{
add()
add(int a, int b)
add(int a, int b, int c)
}

CompileTime Polymorphism --> Overloading 
Runtime Polymorphism  --> Overriding



Demo
Constructor
Static keyword
Final Keyword

String class

Object :-
Tangible --> which you can touch in real
Real world:--> Chair, Table, Computer, Trees, Leaves, fan
Which has state and behavior
state of fan is off 

Computer Science:-
Object is instance of a class

Class :-
Structure/Plan
class is a blue print 

Primitive data type:- 8 types in java 

Object:- --> 

classname variable = new classname();


method:-
business logic --> loops, if

constructor --> why --> starting of class 
--> to initialize global variables
--> is a special method
--> constructor name is same as that of class name
--> no return type -> not even void
--> called automatically when we create a object of class
    --> new Employee(); -> calling constructor
--> default constructor
--> para constructor

startEngine()   --> constructor
runningEngine() --> method
